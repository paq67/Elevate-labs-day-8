This Power BI dashboard is built using the dataset Sample - Superstore.csv, which contains detailed records of orders, including information on sales, profit, order date, customer segments, product categories, and regions. The dashboard is designed to provide interactive insights across multiple pages. Below is a description of Pages 1, 2, and 4.

ðŸ“„ Page 1: Executive Summary The Executive Summary page offers a high-level overview of the businessâ€™s key performance indicators. It includes card visuals that display total sales, total profit, total number of orders, and a dynamic measure for sales growth percentage calculated on a year-over-year basis. A stacked bar chart is used to compare both sales and profit across different regions, giving a quick view of geographic performance. This page also features slicers for Category and Year, allowing users to filter the visuals for specific product categories or time periods. This page serves as the primary snapshot for decision-makers who want to quickly assess the companyâ€™s financial health.

ðŸ“„ Page 2: Sales Trends The Sales Trends page focuses on analyzing performance over time. It features line charts that visualize the progression of sales and profit across the order date timeline, using a date hierarchy for drill-down by year, quarter, and month. A stacked column chart breaks down monthly sales by product category, helping users identify seasonal trends and category contributions. A slicer for customer segment allows the user to filter the entire view based on customer type, such as Consumer, Corporate, or Home Office. This page is particularly useful for identifying sales cycles, revenue growth trends, and forecasting needs.

ðŸ“„ Page 3: Segment & Category Insights This page dives into customer segmentation and product category performance. A pie or donut chart is used to show the distribution of sales across different customer segments. A clustered bar chart compares sales by product category, segmented by customer type, to highlight buying behavior differences. Additionally, a stacked column chart displays quantity sold by region, with each bar split by product category, offering insight into regional category preferences. Slicers for both segment and category are available to allow detailed filtering and customized analysis. This page is valuable for marketers and sales strategists aiming to understand which groups drive revenue and which product lines are most effective in various regions.
